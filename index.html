    <p>In this assignment, we were assigned the task of analyzing the data of a fantasy game Heroes of Pymoli. Like many others in its genre, the game is free-to-play, but players are encouraged to purchase optional items that enhance their playing experience. As a first task, we had to generate a report that breaks down the game's purchasing data into meaningful insights.</p>
<br>

    <p>Our final report needed to include each of the following:</p>            
          
    <ul>
            <li><strong>Player Count:Total Number of Players</strong> </li>
            <li><strong>Purchasing Analysis (Total):Number of Unique Items, Average Purchase Price, Total Number of Purchases, Total Revenue </strong> </li>
            <li><strong>Gender Demographics:Percentage and Count of Male Players, Percentage and Count of Female Players, Percentage and Count of Other / Non-Disclosed </strong> </li>
            <li><strong>Purchasing Analysis (Gender):[Each broken by gender] Purchase Count, Average Purchase Price, Total Purchase Value,Average Purchase Total per Person by Gender </strong> </li>
            <li><strong>Age Demographics: [Each broken into bins of 4 years (i.e. &lt;10, 10-14, 15-19, etc.)]
                    Purchase Count, Average Purchase Price, Total Purchase Value, Average Purchase Total per Person by Age Group </strong> </li>
            <li><strong>Top Spenders: Identified the the top 5 spenders in the game by total purchase value, then list (in a table):
                    * SN
                    * Purchase Count
                    * Average Purchase Price
                    * Total Purchase Value </strong> </li>
            <li><strong>Most Popular Items: Identified the 5 most popular items by purchase count, then list (in a table):
                    * Item ID
                    * Item Name
                    * Purchase Count
                    * Item Price
                    * Total Purchase Value </strong> </li>
            <li><strong>Most Profitable Items: Identified the 5 most profitable items by total purchase value, then list (in a table):
                    * Item ID
                    * Item Name
                    * Purchase Count
                    * Item Price
                    * Total Purchase Value </strong> </li>
        </ul>
            
        <p> As final considerations: We used the Pandas Library and the Jupyter Notebook.</p>
